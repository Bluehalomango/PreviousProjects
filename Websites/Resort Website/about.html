                        then, it has being a ghost town.

                    <p>
                        When we were defining our vision, we 
                        knew that we weren’t starting from a 
                        blank canvas. There still stood a city.So 
                        we made use of it. Turned old into new 
                        and breathed life into the dead. And now, 
                        we have this. A specifally designed section
                        of Pripyat has been given a second chance.
                        All new accommodation, built in the dead
                        bones of the old world. Walk down the 
                        same corridors that families fled down, 
                        with no fear of whats to come. When you 
                        are here, you are under our protection.
                        We built all of this, for you.
                        This is the Escape Zone.

                        with, we had lots of ideas that we wanted to turn real. Most we have,
                        but some we are still working on.
