    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            Do I need to wear shoes?
        </p>
        <p1>
            If you want to have feet that you can walk on by the end of the 
            experience, then yes.

    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            Should I bring a Hazmat suit?
        </p>
        <p1>
            We supply you with our own in the escape rooms where they 
            are neccessary. Do note, we can not promise the quality of 
            said suits. Additionally, in the event of an apocalyptic event 
            or situation class CLEAR SKY, we will repossess the equipment 
            from you and prioritise it to our staff.

    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            Do you keep our valuables secure?
        </p>
        <p1>
            While you go through the escape rooms, we keep all your belongings locked up nice and tight. 
            Only you will have the key so only you will be able to get them. Just make sure to grab your stuff before you leave!

    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            What happens if we go over the time?
        </p>
        <p1>
            Depending on how close you are to finishing, we may give you a grace period to finish it.
            Additionally, our response to your progress is also dependent on the Escape Room you are in.
            See our Terms and Conditions for further information regarding the responsibilities you have
            when you partake in our Escape Rooms.

    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            What happens if we want to leave the Escape Room when we have already started?
        </p>
        <p1>
            As advised in our Terms and Conditions, we have a full commitment policy.
            That is to say, if you start an Escape Room, you have to see it through.
            Unless exceptional circumstances arise, such as a CLEAR SKY or NIGHTFALL class event,
            you will have to go through the entire experience. You paid for the 
            experience and that is what you will get.
        </p1>

    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            Do you provide returns or refunds?
        </p>
        <p1>
            This depends on the grace period you give us. Due to the time
            it takes to prepare each Escape Room and the level of depth
            and detail involved in them, we need at least a weeks notice
            to issue a refund. If you cancel plans with less than a weeks
            notice, we cannot guarantee a full refund.
        </p1>

    <article class="textarea">
        <p>
            Is there a dress code?
        </p>
        <p1>
            In truth, we believe it is wise to dress appropriately for 
            your experience. In some cases, this is to enhance the experience
            but it is also for practical reasons, as outlined in our Terms
            and Conditions. For instance, it would be wise to bring medical
            equipment to treat radioactive poisoning to our 'Meltdown' 
            room incase of failure or warm clothes to our 'Winter' scenario.
