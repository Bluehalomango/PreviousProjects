                        WINTER IS COMING</h1>
                    <p>
                        Winter is coming and you aren't prepared. You thought you would
                        have more time. You thought you would make it back earlier.
                        You thought the blizzard wouldn't hit until next week. But 
                        you were wrong and now, it may cost you everything. You and your team only 
                        have an hour until it hits and you know, if you're outside
                        when it arrives, there will be no hope for you. The mission
                        is still incomplete but you think you can finish it before 
                        the blizzard hits. You know you can't return empty handed,
                         there won't be another chance like this for a long time.
                         It's all or nothing now. 
                    </p>
