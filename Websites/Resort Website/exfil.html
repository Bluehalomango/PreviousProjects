                       TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE</h1>
                    <p>
                        It was just meant to be a quick mission. In and 
                        out, a snatch and grab but things are never that
                        easy. Somehow they knew we were going to be
                        there. Maybe it was a leak, maybe it was luck, it
                        dosen’t matter now. What matters is that you 
                        and your team are stuck in Pripyat, your bird has
                        been shot down, the Russian’s will be there in an
                        hour and you still don’t have the package.
                        It’s going to be tight.
                        Work with your team, locate your objective and
                        find a way out before hell is let loose. You know 
                        the stakes. If they get to you, it’s game over.
                        Don’t let that happen.
