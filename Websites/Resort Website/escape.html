                        How were you supposed to know they locked the 
                        bunker shut for a reason? You thought it was 
                        just old and abandoned but that wasn't true. 
                        This shouldn't be true but it is. Now they, 
                        whatever THEY are, are after you. Freak 
                        mutations, government experimentations, it 
                        doesn't matter. You unleashed them. And 
                        now they are after you. In only an hour, 
                        facility will be overrun and they will escape. 
                        Your life, and maybe everyone elses, comes 
                        down to this. You need to escape and you need 
                        to fix this.
