                        You never thought it would actually happen but here you are.
                        All out nuclear war has begun. It doesn't matter who shot first, 
                        the Americans, Russians, Chinese, French, it doesn't matter. 
                        What matters is that in a matter of an hour, hell itself will 
                        rain fire down across the globe. You weren't expecting this, none 
                        of you were. You were just a simple research team sent out for a 
                        check up on the Chernobyl Zone. You weren't trained and you certainly 
                        weren't prepared. But lucky for you, there is an old Soviet bunker 
                        located somewhere in Pripyat. The catch, you don't know where it is 
                        and you only have an hour but your team is depending on you. 
                        Time to start searching.
