                    <p>
                        You thought you would be safe out here. You
                        thought they wouldn't be able to find you. 
                        But here they are. No matter where you go, they 
                        will track you down. They want you dead. You 
                        know you can't keep running. You need to end 
                        it here. Luckily, you have been preparing for 
                        this for a long time. And now you find yourself 
                        in Pripyat. The perfect location. But you only have 
                        an hour until they get to you. Use that time wisely, 
                        and figure out your plan. Will you kill them, fake your 
                        death or unless something MUCH worse? The choice 
                        is yours. They have been after you for far too 
                        long. It's time to turn the tables.
